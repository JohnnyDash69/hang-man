# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game built with React! In this game, you will guess letters to uncover a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn. If you guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, you win!

## Game Rules

1. The game will pick a random word for you to guess.
2. You can guess the word by selecting letters one at a time.
3. Each incorrect guess will result in a part of the hangman being drawn (e.g., head, body, arms, legs).
4. If you guess all the letters correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, you win!
5. If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose.
6. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart Game" button.
7. The game also provides a help section with rules and instructions.
